# Linked-Binary-Search-Tree
Repository made for the Linked Binary Search Tree task.

# Overview
The main file with the implementation is **linkedbst.py.**
The rest of the files help with the implementation of LinkedBST class.
In this class you can find the **demo_bst(path)** method, which, in fact, demonstrates the effectiveness of a binary search tree for solving search problems and compares it to simply searching the list of items.
The size of the dictionary was decreased to 20000, otherwise the RecursionError would occur.

# Launch example

To launch the comparison, simply run the file as the code to execute the program is written at the end of the file.

```
List search took: 1.2505230903625488sec. 
BST search for ordered dictionary took: 27.145217895507812sec.
BST search for shuffled dictionary took: 0.05049300193786621sec. 
BST search for balanced dictionary took: 0.03928399085998535sec.
