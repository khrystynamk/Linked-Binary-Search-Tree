# Linked-Binary-Search-Tree
Repository made for the Linked Binary Search Tree task.

# Overview
The main file with the implementation is **linkedbst.py.**
The rest of the files help with the implementation of LinkedBST class.
In this class you can find the **demo_bst(path)** method, which, in fact, demonstrates the effectiveness of a binary search tree for solving search problems and compares it to simply searching the list of items.

# Launch example

To launch the comparison, simply run the file as the code to execute the program is written at the end of the file.

```
List search took: 17.74908208847046sec. 
BST search for ordered dictionary took: 0.03914189338684082sec.
BST search for shuffled dictionary took: 0.038536787033081055sec. 
BST search for balanced dictionary took: 0.03229999542236328sec.
